## Overview

GetAI is an AI-powered barcode scanning system developed by our team for the A2SV Hackathon. Our goal is to provide comprehensive and understandable product information to consumers in Africa, addressing the gap in localized and easily accessible usage instructions, safety guidelines, and detailed descriptions.

## Problem Statement

Consumers in Africa face significant challenges in accessing detailed product information, especially in the beauty, healthcare, and food sectors. The lack of localized and easily accessible information can lead to improper product use, health risks, and a lack of consumer confidence. Furthermore, the absence of integration of local languages and cultural relevance complicates this issue, making it difficult for a diverse consumer base to make informed decisions.

## Solution

GetAI aims to solve these challenges by offering a user-friendly, AI-driven barcode scanning system that provides detailed product information in multiple local languages. Our solution ensures accessibility, safety, and enhanced consumer trust by delivering comprehensive information about products, including:

- Usage instructions
- Safety guidelines
- Ingredient lists
- Similar product recommendations
- Locally made alternatives

## Current Methods of Gathering Product Information

Currently, consumers in Africa rely on various methods to gather product information due to the lack of comprehensive solutions like GetAI:

- **Manual Online Searches**: Time-consuming and often yielding inaccurate or incomplete results.
- **Manufacturer Websites**: Limited information and often difficult to navigate.
- **Word of Mouth**: Recommendations from friends, family, or online reviews, which can be inconsistent.
- **Retail Store Assistance**: Dependent on the knowledge of retail staff, which can vary.
- **Social Media Influencers**: Influencer reviews may not be comprehensive or unbiased.
- **Local Market Knowledge**: Reliance on community recommendations, particularly in rural or less digitally connected areas.

These methods highlight the gaps in accessing comprehensive, standardized, and easily accessible product information, underscoring the need for a robust solution like GetAI.

## Why Choose GetAI?

Consumers should choose GetAI over alternative methods for several reasons:

- **Comprehensive Information**: Advanced AI and LLM technology provide detailed usage instructions, safety guidelines, ingredient lists, similar products, and locally made alternatives.

- **Accuracy and Reliability**: AI-powered system delivers accurate and real-time information, eliminating inconsistencies.

- **Alternative Access Methods**: Integration of USSD technology allows users with basic mobile phones to access detailed product information.
- **Empowerment through Knowledge**: Detailed product information helps consumers make informed decisions, promotes safety, and supports local businesses.
- **Accessibility**: Offline capabilities and mobile-friendly design ensure accessibility in areas with limited internet connectivity.

## Target Customer Segments
